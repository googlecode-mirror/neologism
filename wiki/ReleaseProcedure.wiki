#summary For Neologism developers: How to make a new release of Neologism

= Introduction =
This page describes the process for releasing a new version of Neologism, including building the new release zip file, tagging the version in SVN, and updating the website.

= Building the release =
The current version for release is the one at https://neologism.googlecode.com/svn/branches/DRUPAL-6--14
  * Check out the DRUPAL-6--14 branch from Google Code SVN

{{{
svn checkout https://neologism.googlecode.com/svn/branches/DRUPAL-6--14 neologism-d6-svn --username richard@cyganiak.de
}}}

  * Run the `make-archive.sh` script that's in the main directory
  * Rename `neologism.zip` to `neologism-0.x.y.zip`
  * Upload the zip file to Google Code, with the label "Neologism 0.x.y"
  * Make sure that only this latest release is featured on the Google Code project home page

= Tagging the release in the SVN repository =

{{{
svn copy https://neologism.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo https://neologism.googlecode.com/svn/tags/DRUPAL-6--1-0.33 -m 'tagging the 0.33 release'
}}}

= Updating and deploying the website =

{{{
svn checkout https://neologism.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/website neologism-website --username richard@cyganiak.de
}}}

  * In index.php, search for "download-latest" and update it to the URL of the latest release zip
  * In content/home-intro.html, update the version number in the "Download Neologism 0.x.y" button
