To contribute to the NeosVis vocabulary visualization applet, the following steps are required:

  * Check out the current version from svn, NeosVis is located in the */flex-src* folder
  * Create a new project in FlexBuilder 3
  * Copy the contents of the checked out */flex-src* to the newly created */src* folder in your local FlexBuilder 3 project
  * In FlexBuider 3 go to _Project_ -> _Properties_, in the _Flex Applications_ tab add the *Neologism.mxml* application and set it as default
 
All should now run properly.

In case you get the following Flex error: *SecurityError: Error #2148*, go to _Project_ -> _Properties_, in the _Flex Compiler_ tab add the following *-use-network=false* in the _Additional compiler arguments_ field.
