- rename the path /ns
- use only the # convention
- distinguish each property for each class, to work around shared fields
- use ns0 instead of Drupal

- use the best practise convention for classes and proerpties
- remove dependency fix rdf_schema (schema generation + local ns declaration)

- allow multiple values for RDF export text.module

- create a URI for the node
- reuse them as much as possible

cons: tabulator does not read RDFa
