# for the release on d.o
fix a better way to avoid patching rdf_schema. best is to have our own export path /ns in the rdfcck module. implement the export logic in the module directly.


- rename the path /ns
- use only the # convention
- distinguish each property for each class, to work around shared fields
- use ns0 instead of Drupal

- use the best practise convention for classes and proerpties
- remove dependency fix rdf_schema (schema generation + local ns declaration)

- allow multiple values for RDF export text.module

- create a URI for the node
- reuse them as much as possible

cons: tabulator does not read RDFa


- there are still some drupal:field_source_milk in the RDFa output
- how to generalize the relationship made between the master type cheese and the related nodes cheese_review? could extract the relation from views or views_attach?
