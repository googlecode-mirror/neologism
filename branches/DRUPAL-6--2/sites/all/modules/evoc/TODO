#1
handle the case where a different prefix is given during the import than the one defined in the system (in another module or in the db). in this case the import will fail. there should be a warning saying that another prefix has already been defined with the same base URI.

#2
when importing a voc and using an existing prefix, there is an error
user warning: Duplicate entry 'bir' for key 1 query: INSERT INTO rdf_namespaces (prefix, uri) VALUES ('bir', 'http://srvgal65.deri.ie/birf/birf_v3.owl') in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/neo-6--2/sites/all/modules/evoc/evoc.module on line 477.

we should warn that the prefix is already defined, and that its terms will be overwritten.
