How to release a new version of Neologism
=========================================

@@@ TODO this is outdated; should probably copy ALL of trunk to the tag, then use a version of make-archive.sh to build the archive, but use svn export instead of svn co. 

# edit CHANGELOG.neologism.txt and sites/all/modules/neologism/neologism.info in order to update the version number that is being released.
# commit the changes to svn:
svn ci -m 'preparing release 0.33'

# create a tag for this release
svn copy https://neologism.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo https://neologism.googlecode.com/svn/tags/DRUPAL-6--1-0.33 -m 'tagging the 0.33 release'

# export the Neologism files from svn
svn export https://neologism.googlecode.com/svn/tags/DRUPAL-6--1-0.33/ neologism-0.33

# make the zip file and make sure the .htaccess file gets in too!

# try the new package and upload it to googlecode

# switch back the repository to the dev version by editing CHANGELOG.neologism.txt and sites/all/modules/neologism/neologism.info
