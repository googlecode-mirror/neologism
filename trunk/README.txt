The current first version does not provide an installer yet. The installer will be setup later when a more stable version of neologism is available.

To install:
1. copy the demo directory somewhere on your local server, edit demo/sites/default/settings.php and change the db connection details. The current ones are user root, pwd root, and db name dneo.
2. import in a new database (default is dneo) the neologism.sql file
3. go to http://localhost/demo and login with admin (password=neoderi)
4. play around and see what's available so far. I'll do a demo at 5pm.
