  Making the Semantic Web easy! Neologism is a simple web-based RDF Schema vocabulary
  editor and publishing system. Use it to create RDF classes and properties, which are
  needed to publish data on the Semantic Web. Its main goal is to dramatically reduce 
  the time required to create, publish and modify vocabularies for the Semantic Web.</big></p>

<h2>What Neologism is</h2>
<p>@@@ It follows the W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-vocab-pub/">Best Practice for publishing RDF vocabularies</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/">Cool URIs for the Semantic Web</a> guidelines.</p>

<h2>What Neologism is not</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ontology editor</li>
  <li>For large ontologies or vocabularies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick feature list</h2>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No versioning</li>
  <li>No full multi-user with several independent groups</li>
</ul>

<h2>Neologism is built on Drupal</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Drupal 6</li>
  <li>Current version not on drupal.org</li>
  <li>Does not play perfectly with an existing Drupal site. We want to improve that, need help from experienced Drupalers</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we started</h2>
<p>@@@ Short history, including main contributros, original motivation</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>
