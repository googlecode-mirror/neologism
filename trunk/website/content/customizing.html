<p><big>This section is about customizing the information and the appearance regarding colours and logo of a Neologism site without requiring expert knowledge.</big></p> 

<p>This assumes you have administrator's privileges to the Neologism site.  As Neologism is based on Drupal, you might also want to familiarize yourself with some of the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/21951" title="Drupal concepts" >terminology</a> used in Drupal.</p>

<p>To add an about page go to <i>Create content » Page</i>. Once in the <i>Create Page</i> form, type the title of your page (e.g: "About vocab.deri.ie") and then the body of your page.

<h2><a id="enabling-openid"></a>Enabling OpenID for Neologism</h2>
<p>Currently Neologism is built in Drupal 6 and OpenID is in its core. Thus, in order to use OpenID you need to go to <i>Administer » Site building » modules</i> and check the checkbox to enable the OpenID module from the Core package and then click the <i>save configuration</i> button at the end. 
Once the module is enabled the link to log using OpenID will appears at the bottom left of the login form.</p>
