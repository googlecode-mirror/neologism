<p>@@@ TODO</p>

<ul>
  <li>We have a nice Drupal-based installer, ideally just download, upload, and access the page</li>
  <li>Link to Drupal documentation</li>
  <li>What do we need on getting started with Neologism?</li>
</ul>

<h2>@@@ Existing material from the Wiki</h2>
<p>There is some good material in the Wiki that can serve as a starting point: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/neologism/wiki/HowToInstallNeologismAlphaRelease">How to install Neologism Alpha Release</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/neologism/wiki/InstallationManual">Installation Manual</a>. This page here should replace both these pages.</p>
