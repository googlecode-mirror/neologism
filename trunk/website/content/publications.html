<h2>Neologism: Easy Vocabulary Publishing</h2>
<p>Cosmin Basca, Stéphane Corlosquet, Richard Cyganiak, Sergio Fernández and Thomas Schandl</p>
<blockquote><p>“Creating, documenting, publishing and maintaining an RDF 
  Schema vocabulary is a complex, time-consuming task. This makes vocabulary
  maintainers reluctant to evolve their creations quickly in re- 
  sponse to user feedback; it prevents use of RDF for casual, ad-hoc data 
  publication about niche topics; it leads to poorly documented vocabularies,
  and contributes to poor compliance of vocabularies with best- 
  practice recommendations. Neologism is a web-based vocabulary editor 
  and publishing system that dramatically reduces the time required to 
  create, publish and modify vocabularies. By removing a lot of pain from 
  this process, Neologism will contribute to a generally more interesting, 
  relevant and standards-compliant Semantic Web.”</p></blockquote>
