<h2>Why can't I use longer or more structured vocabulary IDs?</h2>

<p>The ID is used as your vocabulary's namespace prefix.
RDF only allows certain characters in prefixes,
and long prefixes are impractical.</p>

<p>You are probably looking for some way to structure the vocabularies
on your site into groups? You can use <strong>URL path settings</strong>
for that. On the form for creating or editing
a vocabulary, scroll down until you find the setting. You can enter a
custom path such as <code>teams/lidrc/2011/myvocab</code>. This will change
the location and namespace URI of the vocabulary, while retaining the
vocabulary ID and prefix.</p>

<p>By default, only the administrator has access to this setting. To enable
it for all users, go to <em>Administer Â» Permissions</em>, and enable the
<em>path module</em> permissions for <em>authenticated users</em>.</p>
