Explains the process of how to import vocabularies into Neologism either from a file located in your filesystem or from the Web.</p>

External vocabularies allow you to use their classes and properties in your own vocabularies. This tutorial explains how to Add and Remove external vocabularies into Neologism.</p>

<p>The following image shows the form to import vocabularies into Neologism:

</p>

<p>As it is shown in the image there are two required parameters in the process of importing a vocabulary, ‘Namespace prefix’ that is used as the ID and the namespace prefix for the imported vocabulary and ‘Namespace URI’ is the URI for the vocabulary that will be imported.</p>

<p>Thus, to import a vocabulary for example the foaf vocabulary type into the Namespace prefix ‘foaf’ and as Namespace URI type ‘http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/’ without the quotes. To finalize the process chick on the ‘Import from the Web’ button if you want to import a vocabulary from the value at ‘Namespace URI’ or click on the ‘Import from file’ button if you want to import a vocabulary from an RDF file on your computer.</p>

<p>Note that the RDF file must be a valid RDF/XML format that contains a RDFs vocabulary or OWL ontology.</p>

<p>External vocabularies allow you to use their classes and properties in your own vocabularies.</p>

<p>The flowing image shows the Manage section for External vocabularies:
<img src="images/screenshots/tutorials-ss-02.png" alt="Screenshot that shows the list of external vocabularies a Neologism installation example." width="95%" />
</p>

<p>To add a new external vocabulary, click the ‘Add new’ link in the ‘External vocabularies’ section. Then in the loaded page will appear the form to add a new external vocabulary as is shown next:
<img src="images/screenshots/tutorials-ss-03.png" alt="Screenshot that shwos the Add external vocabulary form." width="95%" />
</p>

<p>As an example we will add the “RDF Vocabulary Description Languaje 1.0: RDF Schema”. Thus, type into the ‘Namespace prefix’ textfield the ‘rdfs’ prefix and into the ‘Namespace URI’ textfield the URI value ‘http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#’ (both textfield values are without quotes) of the vocabulary respectively, then click on the ‘Submit’ button to execute the add action.</p>

<p>If all the process is executed correctly you will get a page saying that the external vocabulary was added successfully.</p>
